# Alder Lake Opencore

Hello guys,

My Hackintosh setup using OpenCore (0.8.4). I hope this EFI can help you!

- CPU: Intel Core i5-12400
- GPU: AMD Radeon RX 570 4GB
- RAM: 32GB 3200MHz DDR4
- Motherboard: ASUS TUF GAMING B660M-Plus Wifi D4
- SSD: Samsung NVMe 980 500GB
- macOS: Monterey 12.6

### Things that don't work
- Airdrop
- Thunderbolt 4 - Maybe that I haven't tried to make it work :) I will update this later

Others work just fine!
